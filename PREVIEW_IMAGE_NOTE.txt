PREVIEW IMAGE INSTRUCTIONS
==========================

The user has provided an image of Aoi Todo clapping to use as the preview image.

TO ADD THE PREVIEW IMAGE:

1. Save the Aoi Todo image as "preview.png" in this directory
   - The image shows Todo clapping with his hands together
   - It has a dramatic anime style with cyan/teal visual effects

2. After adding preview.png:
   - It will automatically be used when uploading to Steam Workshop
   - The workshop.json already references "preview.png"

3. For GitHub:
   - Consider adding the image to the README or a screenshots folder
   - Could create a banner or logo using the image

The preview.png file should be:
- PNG format (or JPG is also fine, just update workshop.json)
- Recommended size: 512x512 or similar square aspect ratio for Steam Workshop
- Shows Aoi Todo's iconic clapping pose

Note: This file (PREVIEW_IMAGE_NOTE.txt) can be deleted after the preview image is added.
